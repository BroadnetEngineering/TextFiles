# Text File Manipulation
Design an application to manipulate the CSVs in the data directory.

### Your application should accomplish the following:
* Count the number of rows in each file
* Count the number of columns in each file
* Remove rows by matching phone numbers
* Add additional rows
* Allow searching by phone number
* Change the data in a row
* Append the contents of the smaller file to the larger file and then check for and remove duplicates (phone numbers MUST all be unique)

### The app should follow these rules:
* Command line or web based
* Memory footprint should never exceed 1 MB
* No databases
